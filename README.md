# Oasis-Infobyte-Internship

This repository contains the projects completed during my Oasis Infobyte Internship, where I honed my Python programming skills by developing three distinct applications. Each project is designed to tackle a unique problem, showcasing the versatility and power of Python.

## Projects

### 1. BMI Calculator (`bmi_calculator.py`)

The BMI Calculator is a simple yet effective Python program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a user. It takes the user's height and weight as input and computes the BMI, categorizing it into different health ranges:

- Underweight
- Normal weight
- Overweight
- Obesity

This project demonstrates the use of basic mathematical operations and conditional statements in Python.

### 2. Password Generator (`password_generator.py`)

The Password Generator is a Python script designed to create strong, random passwords for enhanced security. Users can specify the length and complexity of the password, including options for:

- Uppercase letters
- Lowercase letters
- Numbers
- Special characters

This project highlights the use of randomization functions and string manipulations in Python.
